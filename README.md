# Video Summarization Using Object Detection
This project implements an object-detection-based video summarization technique using Python, OpenCV, and YOLO. The approach extracts key frames from a video by identifying and analyzing objects of interest, enabling efficient summarization while preserving essential content.

Key Features:
YOLO Integration: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for real-time object recognition.
Frame Processing: Extracts frames using OpenCV and filters them based on detected objects and their significance.
Output: Produces a concise summary video or a collection of key frames.

This method is ideal for applications like surveillance footage analysis, sports summary video, and many more.
